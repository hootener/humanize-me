# Brain adoption feedback — greenfield embedded install

**From**: a Claude Opus 5 / Claude Code session adopting the brain into a brand-new,
empty, non-git repository (`humanize-me`) on 2026-11-08.

**Installed from**: upstream `98bb876`, which was `origin/main` HEAD at clone time.
Two commits behind `642b933` by the time this was written.

**Install performed**: embedded mode, `cp -R` + `rm -rf brain/.git`, `bin/adopt --with-ci`,
`example/` kept. Then `/brain-init` (read from the file, see finding 0).

**Result**: install sound. `bin/doctor` 0/0, `bin/lint` 23 files 0 errors 0 warnings,
`bin/selftest` 29 passed, `bin/stale` clean. One goal, one decision, one principle and
a glossary extension written.

Every claim below was verified against the files; the reproducing command is included
so you can check rather than take my word for it.

## Verified and resolved, 2026-11-08

Every finding reproduced against `642b933` before being fixed; the reporter
installed from `98bb876`, two commits behind, so this was not assumed.

| # | What changed |
|---|---|
| 1 | `bin/index` rebuilds every folder index from the nodes present; `bin/new` calls it, appends the change-log line and rebuilds the graph. `howto.md` no longer promises what nothing did. |
| 5 | `/brain-init` branches on greenfield vs in-flight *before* step 1, and the greenfield branch mines the live conversation with step 3's signal discipline. |
| 2 | `lint` errors on an unfilled `<placeholder>` in a title, a description or a body. First version flagged ten documented command syntaxes and zero real scaffolds; backticks and fences are now skipped. |
| 3 | `bin/new` counts ids under `example/`, so a default install starts at `D0010`. `--bare` still starts at `D0001`. `bin/selftest` asserts no id is used twice anywhere. |
| 4 | `config.md` gains `tracker:` and `docs:`, stubbed by `adopt` and filled by `brain-init`. The tracker choice is now written as a decision, since it has alternatives and a consequence. |
| 0 | `bin/doctor` reports a `.claude/skills` link made in the last ten minutes, so a lucky recovery does not hide the diagnosis. |
| 7 | The README's embedded quickstart opens with `git init`. |
| 6 | `/brain-init` states that same-day forward references among init nodes are fine and not to be worked around. |
| 8 | Fixed by 1: `bin/new` rebuilds the graph, so the staleness warning stops firing after every write. |

Two of these were only findable from outside. **Nothing wrote an index**
while two documents promised something did — the author could not see it
because the author never ran `/brain-init` by the book. And **the default
install shipped an id collision**, which `bin/selftest` passed over because it
skipped `example/` for the same reason `bin/new` did.

---

## 0. Cold start — already fixed, with a nuance your fix doesn't cover

`bin/adopt` printed "Next: run `/brain-init` in Claude Code". `/brain-init` returned
`Unknown skill: brain-init`, because Claude Code discovers skills at session start and
`.claude/skills` was created seconds earlier.

You have already fixed this in `642b933` ("The first cold-start finding: adopt tells
you to run a skill you cannot run"), which adds `⚠ Restart Claude Code before the next
step.` That text is right.

**The nuance**: it self-healed. Several tool calls later the skills appeared in the
session's available-skills list with no restart. A transient failure is worse than a
permanent one here, because an agent that retries after doing something else succeeds
and never learns the rule — so the next adopter's agent rediscovers it from scratch.

Consider having `bin/doctor` report whether `.claude/skills` postdates the current
session, so the diagnosis survives a lucky recovery.

**Side effect worth knowing**: the only way forward was `cat brain/skills/brain-init/SKILL.md`.
That directly contradicts the `using-superpowers` instruction "Never use the Read tool on
skill files." If the brain ships as a Claude Code plugin (your `D0010` ticket), this
goes away.

---

## 1. `howto.md` promises index upkeep that nothing implements  ← fix first

`knowledge-catalog/howto.md:19`:

> The intended path is through the skills ... They handle the format, the taxonomy,
> the ids, the cross-linking and **the index upkeep**.

`CLAUDE.md`:

> Don't hand-edit an index or a log where a skill would write it.

But nothing writes them:

```console
$ grep -rl "log\.md" brain/skills/
(no hits)

$ grep -rln "goals/index\|decisions/index" brain/bin/ brain/skills/
brain/bin/adopt        # only EMPTY_INDEXES, which RESETS them to "(none yet)"
brain/bin/selftest
```

`bin/new` allocates the id and scaffolds the node, and touches no index. So a
by-the-book `/brain-init` ends with `goals/index.md` saying *"(none yet)"* and
`log.md` saying *"(nothing yet)"* while three nodes exist on disk.

The documentation forbids the only action that fixes it. I hand-edited all three
against instructions, because there was no alternative.

**Options**: `bin/new` appends the index row and a `log.md` entry — it already owns id
allocation, so this is the same mechanical job; or the docs stop promising it and say
indexes are hand-maintained.

**Related lint gap**: nothing flags a node absent from its folder index. That is a
natural rule and exactly the silent drift D0001 exists to catch — an index that
confidently says "none yet" is a stale note, which the README argues is worse than no
note at all.

---

## 2. Unfilled scaffolds pass lint clean

```console
$ brain/bin/new evidence "Placeholder lint probe"
knowledge-catalog/reference/E0001-placeholder-lint-probe.md
$ brain/bin/lint
23 files · 0 errors · 0 warnings
```

That node still contained `description: <one sentence>` in its frontmatter and
`<what you observed>` in its body. (The only warning in the run was unrelated
`graph.html` staleness — see finding 8.)

A placeholder reaching the record is an uncheckable claim wearing a node's frontmatter,
which is D0001's precise target, and the gate waves it through. An error on `<...>`
angle-bracket placeholders in frontmatter values and section bodies is a cheap regex
with real value — it would have caught me had I been lazier.

---

## 3. Id collision between `example/` and the live record

```console
$ ls brain/example/knowledge-catalog/decisions/
D0001-claims-must-be-checkable.md   ... through D0009

$ brain/bin/new decision "Dogfood the adoption path"
knowledge-catalog/decisions/D0001-dogfood-the-adoption-path.md
```

Both the README and `CLAUDE.md` state that ids are "flat and global". After a default
install there are two `D0001`s in one tree. In my record `D0001` means *"Dogfood the
adoption path"*; in `CLAUDE.md`, `howto.md`, `config.md` and five skills, `D0001` means
*"claims must be checkable"*.

Because keeping `example/` is the default, every adopter gets this on day one, and prose
citations of the form "see D0001" become ambiguous immediately.

**Options**: renumber `example/` into a reserved band (`D9001+`); have `bin/new` skip ids
present under `example/`; or state in the README that `example/` is a separate namespace.

---

## 4. `brain-init` step 1 elicits answers with nowhere to put them

Four questions are asked. Only one has a destination.

| Q | Destination |
|---|---|
| 1. Which repositories? | Already in `config.md`, written by `adopt`. Redundant in embedded mode — and asking invites an answer that contradicts the file. |
| 2. Where do docs already live? | **Nowhere.** |
| 3. Tracker: mirror or replace? | **Nowhere.** I put it in `log.md` because nothing else fit. |
| 4. What is the project for? | A `goal` node. Works well. |

**Options**: `config.md` gains `tracker:` and `docs:` fields that `adopt` stubs and
`brain-init` fills; or the tracker choice becomes a decision node — it is genuinely one,
with alternatives (mirror / replace) and consequences (two places to keep in step).

---

## 5. The greenfield path has no guidance, and it is a common adoption case

The skill says:

> **A greenfield brain is easy. This is for the hard case**

Then four of its five steps serve the hard case. For this adoption, steps 2, 3 and 4
were complete no-ops:

- Step 2 (import ADRs, `CONTEXT.md`, glossary) — no docs existed.
- Step 3 (mine transcript history) — the only `.jsonl` for this project path was the
  session performing the install.
- Step 4 (mine git history) — `fatal: your current branch 'main' does not have any commits yet`.

**But there was plenty to capture, and it was all in the live conversation.** Both
decisions I recorded came from the user's chat messages:

- `D0002` (human-facing prose only; agent-facing text stays plain) came from the opening
  message — *"We do not care about prose that will be consumed by agents."*
- `D0001` (build the setup path first, generate the maintainer's own voice skills by
  running it) came from one clause in a reply to a clarifying question — *"the goal here
  is to make this an adoptable project, then we'll use the adoptable version to make our
  own voice setup, like any other end user would."*

That second one is a real decision with alternatives and consequences, and it arrived
sideways in an answer to a different question. Nothing in `brain-init` told me to look
there.

**For a greenfield project the current conversation is the only source of decisions that
exists.** Step 3's craft — "the same correction made more than twice", reversals,
standing constraints — is good, and it is all aimed at history that hasn't happened yet.
A greenfield branch that mines the live conversation, using that same signal discipline,
would have cost nothing and is where the value actually was.

---

## 6. The direction rule is inert during `brain-init`

Everything written during init is stamped with today's date, so "nothing cites a node
newer than itself" cannot fire. I wrote `G0001` with a link to `D0001` before `D0001`
existed, and lint passed.

Not a bug — date granularity is the right call. But the skill leans hard on the
direction rule ("twenty-eight times, in the first real adoption"), which is about
*imported* nodes with origin dates. Stating that same-day forward references among init
nodes are fine and intentional would stop an agent wasting effort ordering its writes
or, worse, back-filling dates to force an order.

---

## 7. The README's embedded quickstart omits `git init`

The copy-paste block runs:

```bash
cp -R /tmp/brain-template <project>/brain
rm -rf <project>/brain/.git
cd <project>/brain
bin/adopt
```

On a brand-new project this fails, because `adopt` requires a git host in embedded mode:

> `<host>` is not a git repository. A brain is only checkable against history when it is
> versioned — `git init` it, or use `--sibling`.

That error text is good — it names both exits and the reason. But greenfield adoption
hits it every time, and one line in the README (or `adopt` offering to run `git init`)
removes the stumble entirely.

---

## 8. `graph.html` staleness nags after every write

`bin/lint` warns until `bin/graph-build` runs:

```
warn  graph.html is older than 3 file(s) it is built from (...) — run `brain/bin/graph-build`
```

Across six node writes in one init session this appeared repeatedly. The risk is
learning to ignore a warning, which is the habit D0001 is against. Having `bin/new`
rebuild, or suppressing the warning when graph staleness is the *only* finding, keeps
the signal meaningful. Low priority.

---

## What worked — don't change these

- **`bin/adopt --dry-run`.** It showed the exact `example/` relocation (14 paths) and the
  symlink before touching anything. It is why the install felt safe rather than hopeful.

- **"Copy, do not clone", with the gitlink explanation.** Explaining the failure mode —
  eighty files collapsing into one unresolvable entry, knowledge invisible to the repo
  it is meant to be versioned with — is why I got it right first time instead of reading
  a rule and guessing the reason. `bin/doctor` backstopping it is the right belt-and-braces.

- **`bin/constraints` paid off in the same session the decisions were written.** The
  README promises the return "the second time". But because `constrains:` is declared at
  authoring time, `brain/bin/constraints skills/` already returned both new decisions as
  governing the next piece of work, minutes after writing them. That is a stronger pitch
  than the README currently makes, and worth saying out loud.

- **`ancestry --forward` finding omission.** The genuinely novel capability versus every
  other knowledge tool, and "Nothing outstanding: everything this asked for has landed"
  is exactly the right phrasing.

- **`bin/selftest`'s closing line** — *"A green run locks in what three adoptions taught
  us. It is not evidence the brain is ready for a project it has never met."* Correct
  calibration, and rare. It set my expectations accurately for everything that followed.

- **The `adopt` / `brain-init` split.** Obviously right in practice: I could confirm the
  install was mechanically sound before making a single judgment call, and the two failed
  in different ways as D0004 predicts.

- **`move_example`'s "node files, never whole directories" comment.** I would have made
  that exact mistake, and the comment explains the consequence (a missing index, a
  dangling link, seventeen warnings) rather than just stating the rule.
