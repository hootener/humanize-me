# tasks

The tracker. One OKF `task` file per task, under one folder per initiative.
Ids are global and flat (`T0042`) and are allocated by `brain/bin/new task`;
dependency order lives in `blocked_by`, not in the number. The conventions are
in [../knowledge-catalog/reference/agent-skills/tracker.md](../knowledge-catalog/reference/agent-skills/tracker.md).

Run `brain/bin/status [initiative]` for the task table and the claimable
frontier.

Initiatives:

* *(none yet — `brain/bin/new task "<title>" --initiative <name>`)*

`TODO.md` is the loose list of things to do. It is not a tracker and nothing
reads it programmatically.
